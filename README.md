## üéØ Business Problems & Solutions

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Identify High-Risk Churn Customers**
**Problem:** Which customers are most likely to churn?
**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT customer_id, name, subscription_type, monthly_spending, total_spending
FROM customer_churn
WHERE churn = 1;
```
**Solution:**
- Offer personalized retention plans to high-risk customers.
- Provide discounts or loyalty programs.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Subscription Type vs. Churn Rate**
**Problem:** Which subscription type has the highest churn rate?
**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT subscription_type, COUNT(*) AS churned_customers
FROM customer_churn
WHERE churn = 1
GROUP BY subscription_type
ORDER BY churned_customers DESC;
```
**Solution:**
- Improve features or benefits for the high-churn subscription type.
- Adjust pricing or provide flexible plans.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Monthly Spending vs. Churn**
**Problem:** Is there a pattern between spending and churn?
**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT subscription_type, AVG(monthly_spending) AS avg_spending, COUNT(*) AS churned_customers
FROM customer_churn
WHERE churn = 1
GROUP BY subscription_type;
```
**Solution:**
- Analyze why high-paying customers are leaving.
- Provide better customer service or exclusive benefits.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Engagement (Last Login Analysis)**
**Problem:** Do inactive users have a higher churn rate?
**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS inactive_churned_customers
FROM customer_churn
WHERE churn = 1 AND last_login < '2023-12-01';
```
**Solution:**
- Implement engagement campaigns for inactive users.
- Send personalized emails or offers to re-engage customers.
